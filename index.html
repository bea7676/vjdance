  <h2>FAQs:</h2>

  <p>Yes!! We welcome all genders in our CCA :)<br>
    (most years have a 1:1 ratio of boys and girls, so everyone is welcome and encouraged to join)

  <h2><strong>What if I don’t have prior dance experience?</strong></h2>
  <p>Don’t worry, you just need to have an open mind to try new things and be diligent in practicing. We look for a good attitude and passion for dance. Most boys that join VJD usually have no dance experience, as long as you keep a positive attitude and keep working hard, you'll be fine.</p>

  <h2><strong>What is the culture like in VJD?</strong></h2>
  <p>We are a very close-knit community, where we constantly encourage and support each other, especially when CCA sessions can get exhausting. We are always willing to lend a helping hand to one another and work hard together to grow and put on our best performances. VJD is truly like a family, and we all try our best to help each other grow as dancers and put on our best possible performances, while also enjoying our time together in an environment where we don't feel scared to make mistakes.
